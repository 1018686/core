Hello, 

I have cut a point release for wicketstuff-core version 1.5-RC1.1.  This is the second release against the wicket 1.5-RC1 version.

There were problems with my release process for the 1.5-RC1 version (I promoted incomplete repositories) and the wicket trunk 1.5-SNAPSHOT is now different from the 1.5-RC1 version.

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>datatables</artifactId>
<version>1.5-RC1.1</version>
</dependency>

The release tag is here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/wicketstuff-core-1.5-RC1.1

Development on the next release takes place on the master branch here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core

The plan is to wait until the wicket 1.5-RC2 version is released before releasing again.  If it takes more than a month for this to happen 
I might cherry-pick the patches that will apply with wicket 1.5-RC1 but I hope to not have to.

If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
