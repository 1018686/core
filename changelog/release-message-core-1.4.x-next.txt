Hello, 

Following the release of wicket 1.4.16 I've cut a matching release for wicketstuff-core.

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>some recently changed artifact</artifactId>
<version>1.4.16</version>
</dependency>

The release tag is here: TODO

A new stable branch core-1.4.16.x has been created with an initial pom version of 1.4.16.1-SNAPSHOT

The core-1.4.x branch has been updated with a new pom version of 1.4.17-SNAPSHOT

Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.4.16:

<artifactId>:
<list of key changes or bugfixes included in this release>

wicketstuff-push:
  - introduced IPushEventContext
  - introduced broad casting channels
    -> renamed IPushChannel to IPushNode
    -> added new IPushChannel interface representing a broadcasting channel
    -> IPushService: an event can now either be send to a push node directly (1-1 communication) or to a broadcasting channel (1-n communication)

console:
  - Wicket Console is a new wicketstuff module
  - provides components for executing dynamic languages code at runtime
  - currently supported languages are Groovy and Clojure

The plan is to release a 1.4.16.1 point release within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
