Hello, 

Following the release of wicket 1.4.x I have created a matching wicketstuff-core release from the core-1.4.x branch.

[or] 

Following a request for a new release I have created a new point release of wicketstuff-core, version 1.4.x.y.  

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>some recently changed artifact</artifactId>
<version>1.4.x.y</version>
</dependency>

The release tag is here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/wicketstuff-core-1.4.x.y

Issues can be reported here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/issues

The Project Wiki is available here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki


Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.4.x.y:

<artifactId>:
<list of key changes or bugfixes included in this release>


The plan is to release a 1.4.x.y point release within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
