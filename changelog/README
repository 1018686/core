Wicketstuff Developers:

The 'release-message-1.5.x-next.txt' file should be updated to include 
the content you would like to appear in the announce message regarding key 
changes for the next master version.

The next version will either be released to match a new upstream wicket version 
or a point release against the current stable wicket version.

When the release is made the current copy of the file will be copied to a 
concrete version number and the content of the -next.txt file reset for 
the next version.
