Hello, 

Following the release of wicket 1.5-next I've cut a matching release for wicketstuff-core.

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>some recently changed artifact</artifactId>
<version>1.5-RC1</version>
</dependency>

The release tag is here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/wicketstuff-core-1.5-next

Development on the next release takes place on the master branch here: https://github.com/wicketstuff/core

Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.5-next:

<artifactId>:
<list of key changes or bugfixes included in this release>


The plan is to release again within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
