Hello, 

Following the release of wicket 1.5-RC1 I've cut a matching release for wicketstuff-core (https://github.com/wicketstuff/core).

Many of the projects presently in the 1.4.15 release are present in this release.  However there are several that still need to be adapted to the 
changes introduced by wicket 1.5.  

We will continue the 1.4.x wicketstuff-core series for the forseable future.

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>progressbar</artifactId>
<version>1.5-RC1</version>
</dependency>

Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.5-RC1:

gae-initializer:
A new project in WicketStuff family.
Putting gae-initializer.jar in the classpath of your application will automatically configure it so that it can run in Google AppEngine.
The configuration includes:
 - disable the resource polling
 - set IObjectStreamFactory which doesn't extend Object(Input|Output)Streams
 - set HttpSessionDataStore as a storage for the page history

The plan is to release again within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
