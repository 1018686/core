# Wicketstuff JavaDoc
This branch contains the JavaDocs for WicketStuff sub-projects. JavaDocs can be generated with the following steps:

1. from root folder run Maven command `mvn javadoc:aggregate`
2. by default the JavaDocs are generated under `target/site/apidocs`
3. copy folder `apidocs` to its corresponding folder (`javadoc6` for `wicket-6.x` branch, `javadoc7` for `master` branch etc...).
